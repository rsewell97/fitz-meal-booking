# fitz-meal-booking
Automate fitz meal booking to beat the queue. In python based on Selenium

Simply enter your crsID and password when the authentication is called. Enter dietary preferences and booking date at top and it will refresh every 10secs to ensure you are booked on to the meal

Based on website version 14/11/2018, testing reccomended. I accept no liability for missed bookings.
